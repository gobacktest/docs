# Journal

These journal entries are written as notes with a [slip-box][1] like system, a.k.a [Zettelkasten][2].

Every entry file uses a naming scheme in the way of `YYMMDDhhmm_title-slug.md`, where `YYMMDDhhmm` translates to the date and time the file was created. An example is `2006092041_some-title.md`.

THere are more detailed id's in the form of `YYYYMMDDhhmmss` which I think would be overkill.
